A history of my progress through the "Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow" course found here:
https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/learn/v4/overview

I highly recommend this course, as it teaches an impressive array of modern tools at the perfect level of detail, and in the end produces an excellent finished product.
